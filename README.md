# From  dash.plot.ly - Introduction to Dash
Dash is a productive Python framework for building web applications.

Written on top of Flask, Plotly.js, and React.js, Dash is ideal for building data visualization apps with highly custom user interfaces in pure Python. It's particularly suited for anyone who works with data in Python.

Through a couple of simple patterns, Dash abstracts away all of the technologies and protocols that are required to build an interactive web-based application. Dash is simple enough that you can bind a user interface around your Python code in an afternoon.

Dash apps are rendered in the web browser. You can deploy your apps to servers and then share them through URLs. Since Dash apps are viewed in the web browser, Dash is inherently cross-platform and mobile ready.

There is a lot behind the framework. To learn more about how it is built and what motivated Dash, watch our talk from Plotcon below or read our announcement letter.

Dash is an open source library, released under the permissive MIT license. Plotly develops Dash and offers a platform for easily deploying Dash apps in an enterprise environment. If you're interested, please get in touch.


## My personal interest in this project revolves around having built a dash-like front end a few years back for a social analytics site with plotly and js.  This would have been much easier!
